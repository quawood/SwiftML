MOST RECENT CHANGES LOG:

Implemented linear regression with freedom to choose type of polynomial.
Current issues:
* Difficult to increase degree past 5 without needing to wait significant time for graph
* current learning rate set to 0.001 and iterations set to 100000, time to create regression to significant

Ideas for fixes:
*feature normalization

I want to be able to also create regression for curves that are not functions (such as points around a circle)
